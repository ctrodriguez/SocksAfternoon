             <p>Socks followed the strange noise to the kitchen window. It was an odd bug! Black and yellow with a scary looking face! It was flying and bouncing against the window. Maybe Socks could get it and save her family from the bug! She wonders how it would taste.</p>
        <p> What should Socks do?</p>
