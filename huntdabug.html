    <h1>Socks decided to hunt the bug!</h1>
        <p>It was time to defend her family once again! She moved the curtain with her little pink paw and the bug flew out and buzzed around. Socks jumped to the kitchen table and batted at the bug she kept missing! She was determined to protect her family!</p>
        <p>Her big human sister was staring into the weird box thing near where she slept last. She saw what Socks was doing. She saw Socks' heroic act!</p>
        <p>Her human sister shouted, and ran towards her, grabbing Socks from the table. They watched as the strange bug flew out the open window. Her human sister placed Socks back on the table and closed the window.</p>
