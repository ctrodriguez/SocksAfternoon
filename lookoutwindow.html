        <h1>Socks decided to look out the window!</h1>
        <p>Socks hopped off her chair and walked slowly towards the window in the living room. She hopped up onto an old desk and stared at the window. Silently waiting for a bird to land on top of the air conditioner in the window. Socks suddenly heard a buzzing noise from the kitchen.</p>
        <p> What should Socks do?</p>
